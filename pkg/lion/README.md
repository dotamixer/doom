# Config [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/micro/go-config?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/micro/go-config)

Go Config is a pluggable dynamic config library.

Most config in applications are statically configured or include complex logic to load from multiple sources. 
Go Config makes this easy, pluggable and mergeable. You'll never have to deal with config in the same way again.

## Features

- **Dynamic** - load config on the fly as you need it
- **Pluggable** - choose which source to load from; file, env, consul
- **Mergeable** - merge and override multiple config sources
- **Observable** - Watch the config for changes
- **Safe** - specify fallback values where keys don't exist

## Getting Started
